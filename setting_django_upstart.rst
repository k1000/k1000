Server instrumentation with Django and upstart
==============================================

Create the init script for upstart in ``/etc/init/upstart-job.conf`` 
::
  start on runlevel [2345]
  stop on runlevel [06]
  respawn
  respawn limit 10 5
    
  script
    NAME=trenpa
    PORT=8002
    NUM_WORKERS=3
    TIMEOUT=120
    USER=shop
    GROUP=shop
    LOGFILE=/var/log/gunicorn/$NAME.log
    LOGDIR=$(dirname $LOGFILE)
    test -d $LOGDIR || mkdir -p $LOGDIR
    cd /home/shop/archive_db/pro
    exec /home/shop/archive_db/env/bin/gunicorn \
    --env DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$NAME.settings \
    $NAME.wsgi:application \
    -w $NUM_WORKERS -t $TIMEOUT \
    --user=$USER --group=$GROUP --log-level=debug \
    --name=$NAME -b 78.47.135.2:$PORT
    --log-file=$LOGFILE 2>>$LOGFILE
  end script

.. note:: PORT=8002 must match the number you configured in server configuration. In case you are running multiple websites on the same machine you'll have to increment this number accordingly.

.. note:: As a rule-of-thumb set the --workers (NUM_WORKERS) according to the following formula: 2 * CPUs + 1. The idea being, that at any given time half of your workers will be busy doing I/O. For a single CPU machine it would give you 3.

Add new system service
::
  # sudo ln -fs /etc/init/upstart-job /etc/init.d/upstart-job

Make it starts at system boot
::
  # sudo update-rc.d upstart-job defaults

And start it now
::
  # sudo service upstart-job start
